# Work Day Planner Challenge

## About

This is just a simple work day planner to help yo uorganize your tasks in an efficient way. It stores whatever you save on the text boxes and is color 
coated to keep track of what is the current task. Grey boxes are the past hour blocks so they should completed, red is the current hour block, and green
are the upcoming hour blocks.

This site was made using API's like JQuery and Bootstrap just to make it more efficient and concise. I also used MomentJs to get the current date and time 
so the planner updates live.

If you would like to see how the website looks and works, just click on the link [here](https://rubenfr74.github.io/day-planner-challenge/).

Thanks to the instructor for commenting some great hints in the starter code.

I also want to thank Boostrap and JQuery for making coding a little easier.
